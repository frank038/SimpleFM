This program has three parts.

The left part lists all the mimetypes listed known by the distro
(if it follows the freedesktop rules).

The upper right part.
This part lists the extensions (if any) and the executables (if any) 
associates to the selected mimetype in the left part.
Regarding the executables, if one of them is the default program for that 
mimetype it will be marked with (*). All the custom associations made in 
the mimeapps.list (placed in the HOME/.config folder) will be shown 
as follow: those added will be marken with (+) or (+*); those removed 
will be marked with (-).

The lower right part.
Three buttons: the "Make default" button will make the selected executable 
the default application for the mimetype selected; the "Add" button will 
show a dialog that let user choose which installed application 
(through the desktop files) will be added as executable for the selected 
mimetype (it will be marked with (+)); the "Remove" button removes first 
the "*" if the executable is marked with (+*) and the second time the 
executable from the right list, also whether it is marked with (-).

This program can only make changes in the mimeapps.list file located 
in the "HOME/.config" folder.
